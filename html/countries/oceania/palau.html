          <h3>Ngerulmud</h3>
          <p>Ngerulmud is the seat of government of the Republic of Palau, an island nation in the Pacific Ocean. It replaced Koror City, Palau's largest city, as the capital in 2006. The settlement is located in the state of Melekeok on Babeldaob, the country's largest island, located 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Koror City and 2 km (1 mile) northwest of Melekeok City. It is the least-populous capital city of a sovereign nation in the world.
          The name Ngerulmud precedes the area's designation as capital. It refers to the hill, overlooking the ocean, that dominates the site.
          Ngerulmud is derived from a Palauan phrase meaning "place of fermented angelfish". The last syllable, mud, is the Palauan word for Centropyge tibicen, also known as the keyhole angelfish. In the past, under a local tradition, women gathered on the hill to offer fermented angelfish to the gods.
