          <h3>Wellington</h3>
          <p>The capital of New Zealand owes its name to the first Duke of Wellington , who emerged victorious from the Battle of Waterloo against the Napoleonic troops. Its foundation dates back to the 10th century when Hawaiki’s chief Kupe explored the region and settled his people. Europeans arrived in the mid- 19th century , when the British disembarked from the Tory vessel at the mouth of the Hutt River.
            The southernmost capital of the world is known by New Zealanders as Windy Wellington because the winds are a very common meteorological phenomenon and in winter they reach the descriptions of windstorms. On the other hand, the fact that its natural harbor is in an active geological fault causes the terrain to rise sharply and form numerous hills from which you can enjoy wonderful views. In front of the port are three islets Matiu / Somes (the only one inhabited), Makaro / Ward and Mokopuna that can be visited by ferry.
