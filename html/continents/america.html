          <h3>San Jose</h3>
          <p> Although most tourists enter Costa Rica through the international airport just outside this city, few travelers take the time to soak in San José’s gritty charm. Costa Rica’s bustling capital and population center is not a bad place to hang out for a few days, or to get things done that can’t be done elsewhere, but it isn’t a major tourist destination. Still, that lack of tourism makes the city feel uniquely Tico. And because San José is the country’s biggest urban center, it has varied and active restaurant and nightlife scenes, museums and galleries worth visiting, and a steady stream of theater, concerts, and other cultural events that you won’t find elsewhere in the country.</p>

          <h3>Rio de Janeiro</h3>
          <p>Rio de Janeiro, in full Cidade de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, byname Rio, city and port, capital of the estado (state) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is located on the Atlantic Ocean, in the southeastern part of the tropical zone of South America, and is widely recognized as one of the world’s most beautiful and interesting urban centres. Although Rio de Janeiro continues to be the preeminent icon of Brazil in the eyes of many in the world, in reality its location, architecture, inhabitants, and lifestyle make it highly unique when compared with other Brazilian cities, especially the country’s capital of Brasília or the much larger city of São Paulo. The former is a much smaller city dating back only to the 1960s, while the latter is a huge, sprawling commercial and manufacturing centre with none of Rio’s spectacular natural beauty or captivating charm. Unlike Rio, both are located on flat interior plateaus.</p>

          <h3>Cancun</h3>
          <p>Cancún, city and adjacent island resort area, Quintana Roo estado (state), southeastern Mexico. Ciudad Cancún (Cancún city) is located on the northeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula, facing the Caribbean Sea. It is essentially a service town for the L-shaped resort area of Isla Cancún (Cancún Island), which is 13 miles (21 km) long by 0.25 mile (400 metres) wide. The Cancún Island resort area (also called the Zona Hotelera [“Hotel Zone”]) is linked by a causeway to Cancún city. The island, with its skyscraper hotels and sprawling resorts, and the coastal area occupied by Cancún city have abundant white sand beaches, palm groves, and coral reefs. The warm, tropical climate has a short rainy season.</p>

          <h3>Miami Beach</h3>
          <p>Miami Beach, city, Miami-Dade county, southeastern Florida, U.S. It lies on a barrier island between Biscayne Bay (west) and the Atlantic Ocean (east), just east of Miami. The area was originally inhabited by Tequesta and later by Seminole Indians. Until 1912 the site was a mangrove swamp, where growers tried unsuccessfully to establish coconut plantations but had better luck with avocado groves. John S. Collins, Carl Fisher, and John and James Lummus pioneered real estate development there, and through their efforts a bridge was built across the bay (followed by a causeway in 1920). Dredging subsequently added land area to the island. The city was incorporated in 1915 as Ocean Beach, and the name was changed to Miami Beach the following year.</p>

          <h3>Resistencia</h3>
          <p>Resistencia is a fairly large city in the north East of the country and the largest city in Argentina's Chaco region. It is famous for its statues. It is hard to find a street in the city center that doesn't contain a statue of some kind. Resistencia is a modern city but there are some older buildings around the city.</p>
