          <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
          <p>Tokyo, formerly (until 1868) Edo, city and capital of Tokyo to (metropolis) and of Japan. It is located at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central Honshu. It is the focus of the vast metropolitan area often called Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in Japan. The site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times; the small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries. Edo’s development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate. During this period, however, the imperial family remained in Kyōto, the ancient imperial capital. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo. The city was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital.”

          <h3>Como Lake</h3>
          <p>Lake Como, also known as Lario, is the third largest Italian lake (after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore). Located at the foot of the Alps, Lake Como offers some of the most romantic and picturesque sceneries in the world.

            Its characteristic shape, resembling an inverted Y, comes from the melting of glaciers combined with the erosive action of the ancient Adda river. This led to the formation of the two southern branches that culminate in the cities of Como and Lecco, in the middle of which lies the famous Bellagio. 
            
            You will be surprised to learn about the many things to do on Lake Como, especially if you decide to stay more than one day!
            
            The distances between towns are such that you can visit at least 3 or 4 villages by local transportation, and you can lose yourself among enchanting villas and gardens, relax with a private boat tour or on your favorite beach, and even rejuvenate with a healthy nature walk.</p>

          <h3>Malmö</h3>

          <h3>Bratislava</h3>
          <p>Bratislava situated in the south-west of Slovakia stretches on both banks of the Danube and in the foothills of the Little Carpathian Mts. Thanks to this favourable position it was always a commercial centre. Today the historic places witnesses to the rapid development of the young Slovak Republic. In spite of its exciting history, Bratislava is one of the youngest Capitals of the world and its population is also very young. The modern metropolis is opened to Europe and to the world as proved by the increasing number of foreign visitors of most diverse countries. They are attracted by the cosiness of the rather small city that nevertheless possesses a throbbing social life and historic charms combined with the most recent trends. Palaces, modern shopping and trade centres, admirable arts of the Slovak cooks and brewers, friendly people and various international cultural or sport events, exhibitions, and business opportunities are the reasons why it is worth of visit.</p>

          <h3>Vien</h3>
          <p>Austria’s capital Vienna offers a blend of imperial traditions, music, and endearing charm. A city that inspires with the old and the new alike, and always has a cosy place available in a coffee house or wine tavern.
            Vienna’s history dates back to the first post-Christian century, when the Romans established the military camp Vindobona. Today’s cityscape is characterised by the abundance of Baroque buildings created mostly under the rule of Empress Maria Theresia (1740 - 1780) and Franz Joseph (1848 - 1916), who was largely responsible for the monumental architecture in the city's centre.
